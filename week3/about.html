    <h2> About <em>JUMBLE</em> </h2>
    <p><em>Jumble</em> is tool for creating hybridized stories, both fictional and non-fictional, by analyzing parts of speech and performing substitutions based on these.  Move the slider to adjust the jumble-ratio.  The source with the higher weighting, ie. the ratio is in its favour, will form the base template for the result.</p>

    <p> For example, if the ratio sourceA:sourceB is 80:20, the resulting text will replace 20% of sourceA's (the base) body with that of sourceB (the source).  The algorithm steps through the base text word by word.  During each iteration, a random number between 0 and 100 is generated, if this random number is greater than the base text's weighting, ie. 80 from our previous example, the algorithm executes a function to determine the given word's part of speech.  Once the part of speech has been identified, the word is replaced by a word with the same part of speech from the source text (ie the source with the lower ratio value).
