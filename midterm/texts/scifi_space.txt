The Tau-Epsilon star system was remote even by Star Fleet standards, of course this was one of the reasons it was chosen. It was also a very crowded system with twelve planets and 6 different asteroid belts.  The five innermost planets were 'rocks' with the rest being gas giants.  The system also had a very uneven planetary plane making theinner planets a little bit more difficult to approach.  
The fourth planet from the yellow Tau-Epsilon sun had abarely breathable atmosphere.  In years past there had been a small mining operation on the planet but it had been abandoned for a more profitable system.  The habitats left behind, however, had made a great base camp for the project now nearing completion.    Star Fleet didn't normally make a habit of constructing a star ship in such a remote location.  This ship, however, was extremely unique not only in its design but also in its mission.    The flat black of the space dock girders hung in a closeorbit around TE-4.  Inside the frame work was a truly different star ship.  The large saucer section and warp engines made it unmistakably Star Fleet.  The saucer section was obviously old, even the lowest cadet at the academy would know that it shouldn't be tied to the new style warp engines especially four of them. 
There were a number other things that a trained eye would pick out wrong with this ship.  Some that shouldn't be on a saucer section that old and others that simply were not Star Fleet standard.
