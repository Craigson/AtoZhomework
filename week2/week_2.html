    <h3>Week 2: Progress thus far...<h3>
    <p><em>Perhaps I bit of more than I could chew for week 2's assignment, seeing as the vast majority of my sticking points were easily overcome by the use of regex.  The gist of the webapp is to take two different pieces of text and to "jumble" them up to create a new, and hopefully coherent, text. The slider allows the user to select the ratio of how much of each story to mix into the result.  Selecting an 80:20 (A:B) ratio will result in 4x more content from source A than from Source B.</em></p>

    <p><em>The algorithm works by breaking each source text into its constituent parts of speech.  The text with the heigher weighting in the Jumble Ratio is used as the base text.  The algorithm loops over every word in the base text and replaces each word with a word with the same part of speech from the other text.</em></p>

    <p><em>I'm at the point where I've broken down each source into elements of parts of speech, I simply need to figure out how to replace the necessary words and recombine them into a final result. </em></p>

      <p>Source A:</p>
      <textarea id = "sourceA" rows = "10" cols = "100">It was in a better frame of mind that the small force set out across the open country toward the trim and well-kept farm buildings of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke; but disappointment was to be their lot since neither Tarzan of the Apes nor his son was at home.

Lady Jane, ignorant of the fact that a state of war existed between Great Britain and Germany, welcomed the officers most hospitably and gave orders through her trusted Waziri to prepare a feast for the black soldiers of the enemy.

Far to the east, Tarzan of the Apes was traveling rapidly from Nairobi toward the farm. At Nairobi he had received news of the World War that had already started, and, anticipating an immediate invasion of British East Africa by the Germans, was hurrying homeward to fetch his wife to a place of greater security. With him were a score of his ebon warriors, but far too slow for the ape-man was the progress of these trained and hardened woodsmen.

When necessity demanded, Tarzan of the Apes sloughed the thin veneer of his civilization and with it the hampering apparel that was its badge. In a moment the polished English gentleman reverted to the naked ape man.

His mate was in danger. For the time, that single thought  dominated. He did not think of her as Lady Jane Greystoke, but rather as the she he had won by the might of his steel thews, and that he must hold and protect by virtue of the same offensive armament.

It was no member of the House of Lords who swung swiftly and grimly through the tangled forest or trod with untiring muscles the wide stretches of open plain--it was a great he ape filled with a single purpose that excluded all thoughts of fatigue or danger.

Little Manu, the monkey, scolding and chattering in the upper terraces of the forest, saw him pass. Long had it been since he had
thus beheld the great Tarmangani naked and alone hurtling through the jungle. Bearded and gray was Manu, the monkey, and to his dim old eyes came the fire of recollection of those days when Tarzan of the Apes had ruled supreme, Lord of the Jungle, over all the myriad life that trod the matted vegetation between the boles of the great trees, or flew or swung or climbed in the leafy fastness upward to the very apex of the loftiest terraces.</textarea><br/>
      <p>Source B:</p>
      <textarea id = "sourceB" rows = "10" cols = "100">The Munchkin folks, however, merely stand off and look at Mount Munch and know very little about it; for, about a third of the way up, its sides become too steep to climb, and if any people live upon the top of that great towering peak that seems to reach nearly to the skies, the Munchkins are not aware of the fact.

But people DO live there, just the same.  The top of Mount Munch is shaped like a saucer, broad and deep, and in the saucer are fields where grains and vegetables grow, and flocks are fed, and brooks flow and trees bear all sorts of things.  There are houses scattered here and there, each having its family of Hyups, as the people call themselves.  The Hyups seldom go down the mountain, for the same reason that the Munchkins never climb up: the sides are too steep.

In one of the houses lived a wise old Hyup named Bini Aru, who used to be a clever Sorcerer.  But Ozma of Oz, who rules everyone in the Land of Oz, had made a decree that no one should practice magic in her dominions except Glinda the Good and the Wizard of Oz, and when Glinda sent this royal command to the Hyups by means of a strong-winged Eagle, old Bini Aru at once stopped performing magical arts.  He destroyed many of his magic powders and tools of magic, and afterward honestly obeyed the law.  He had never seen Ozma, but he knew she was his Ruler and must be obeyed.

There was only one thing that grieved him.  He had discovered a new and secret method of transformations that was unknown to any other Sorcerer.  Glinda the Good did not know it, nor did the little Wizard of Oz, nor Dr. Pipt nor old Mombi, nor anyone else who dealt in magic arts.  It was Bini Aru's own secret.  By its means, it was the simplest thing in the world to transform anyone into beast, bird or fish, or anything else, and back again, once you know how to pronounce the mystical word: "Pyrzqxgl."</textarea><br/>
